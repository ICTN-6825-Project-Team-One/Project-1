				There is no other city in the United States that celebrates the spirit of childhood quite like Orlando, Florida. While main attractions include theme parks like Universal Studios, Walt Disney World Resort, Lego Land, and SeaWorld Orlando, there are tons of other fun, cost-effective activities. Orlando supplies fun activities regardless of the weather conditions. Monkey Joe Playground, an indoor play gym aimed at families with kids aged 12 and under, features inflatable slides, exciting climbing walls, fun obstacle courses, and popular arcade games. The notion that only young ones will enjoy the city's charms is just that, a notion. In reality, Orlando has a little of this and a little of that to appeal to all ages. Lake Eola Park, in Downtown Orlando, is a location like has fun for the whole family. Snap photos of the swans as you enjoy gliding through the water in a swan paddleboat. If you time it right, you might also be able to catch a free concert or event at the park’s Walt Disney Amphitheater. The whole family can also enjoy bowling, billiards, video games, and other fun activities, not to mention some great food, at Pointe Orlando’s Main Event Entertainment. Less than a mile from Pointe Orlando, Ripley’s Believe It or Not! has a host of wonderfully weird exhibits from around the world.
