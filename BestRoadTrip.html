				<p>
				In his 1982 memoir “Blue Highways”, the journalist and author William Least Heat-Moon chronicled his road trip around the U.S. in a worn-our Econoline van. At a crossroads in his personal and professional life, Least Heat-Moon felt the need to “get out of the way of life.” He vowed to stick to America’s blue highways; those small, forgotten, out-of-the-way roads often shown in blue in older Rand McNally road atlases from the 1950s and 1960s.<br>
				His recollections of the people and places he found along the way helped a generation of readers to see rural and small-town America in a new way. Some 40 years later, the geographical, social and political divides that consume urban and rural America call on all of us to embark on our own blue highway adventures, and seek to strengthen our common bonds.<br>
				Least Heat-Moon’s original trek can be divided into seven segments: Columbia MO to Wanchese, NC; Wanchese to St. Martinville, LA;  St. Martinville to Cedars Break, UT; Cedars Break to Liberty Bond, WA; Liberty Bond to Harbor Beach, MI; Harbor Beach to Othello, NJ; and Othello back to Columbia. Each segment is a 1 ½- to 2-week journey. Do yourself a favor and start after Easter, and end by Labor Day; otherwise, you may encounter difficult winter conditions from Liberty Bond to Harbor Beach. Finally, take along a laptop and blog about your journeys, like the many fellow travelers whom Least Heat-Moon inspired.
